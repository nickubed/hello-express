# Get Started with Express!

If I want this to work on my computer, what do I do???

It's simple! All you have to do is clone this repository to your computer, then:
```bash
cd hello_express
npm i
```
and when it finishes installing, simply:
```bash
nodemon
```

Your app will be listening on PORT 3000, you can access it in your browser by (while nodemon is running) entering localhost:3000 into your URL bar.
